<title> Why i like GOA</title>
<h1>Why i like GOA?</h1>
<p>I finally took the plunge into programming. For years, it had been a fascination,
     but the right moment never came until I discovered Goal Oriented Academy (GOA).
      Online learning made it easier for me to dive in and connect with the material.
       I had considered several options, but the friendly atmosphere at GOA felt like home.
        My mentors, true professionals, share their own stories, echoing my own fears and aspirations.
         This connection makes every lesson feels more personal. Right now,
         GOA is organizing trips and activities that bring us together and enrich our learning experience and simply having fun.
          Each session is a mix of coding challenges and life lessons, as they guide us through our struggles with patience and understanding.
           With every line of code,
    Iâ€™m growing more confident, knowing Iâ€™m on a journey shared by manyðŸ¤©ðŸ©·.</p>
