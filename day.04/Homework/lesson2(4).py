#Case sensitivity:
#in python,uppercase and lowercase are totally different.So,if you have "Myname" and "myname",it turns
# out to be compeletely different variables. You have to be consistent,or it'll get confused. 

#Snake case:
#Snake case is just a way to name things so theyâ€™re easier to read. 
# You put some words together with underscores, like 'Dog_name'.
