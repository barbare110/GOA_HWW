# print(Hello World) #1. print("Hello World")

#My_name="Barbare"
#print(my_name) #2. print(My_name)

#age = "20"
#if age > 18;  #3.  Correct: if int(age) > 18:

#age=input("What is your name?") #4.age=input("what is your age?")

#print("20"+ 20) #print(20+20) tecnically not a mistake but you can't do math with strings
