# Techniques for Representing Algorithms

# 1. Step-by-Step
# Lists each action in the order they should be performed.

# 2. Flowchart
# Uses shapes and arrows to visually represent the flow of the algorithm, so its easy

# 3. Pseudocode
# A simplified code-like format that outlines the logic of the algorithm 
# without using specific programming syntax.
