result = True or (5 > 3) or ("name" == "name" and 123 == "123" and 5 >= 5)
print(result) 

# Explanation:
# The expression starts with 'True', so it evaluates to True regardless of the rest.
# (5 > 3) and ("name" == "name") are True but unnecessary.
# (123 == "123") is False and doesn't affect the outcome.
# (5 >= 5) is True but also not needed.
# The final result is True.
